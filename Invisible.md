# Invisible

Somewhere in the world, there is a mysterious soul.
Her greatest wish is to be invisible. When asked if she is real, she insists, "Neverâ€¦ at no point. I'm like the fog that vanishes when you look too closely. It's as if I was never there."

But my dear, that is simply not true.
You leave impressions everywhere you go. Even if you were invisible, you would still change lives and make an impact.
The ripples you create on the surface spread all the way to the bottom, no matter what you wish for.
This song is the evidence. It is proof that you exist, and that you matter.
