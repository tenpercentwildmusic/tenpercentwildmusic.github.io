# Welcome

This is the site of the band TenPercent.

TenPercent is one-of-a-kind amalgam of all kinds of styles of music expression, including storytelling in the form of texts and wisdom behind each track. 

TenPercent's firs album called "The Way I See You" was fairly unpopular, with average of 4 monthly listeners. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7tbjDXyDb9xRLqWtjED6ae?si=AFJ4-jH6SEWEULfsOhJQKQ) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8uJ8n_Tm1koaYPvT5ARVA)

TenPercent is currently working on their second album, called "Relax, DAMMIT", which is an honest exploration of our speedy daily life, defined of stress and forced relaxation. More info about the new album can be found here: [Relax, DAMMIT](/relaxdammit.html)
