The wow effect

I once ran into my neighbor, who was carrying two long, round cardboard packages, seemingly poster tubes.
"What's that?" I asked.
She seemed very excited to explain that she had ordered two star charts for her kids, each showing the constellations as they were at the moment of their birth.
"Hm, that seems exciting," I said. "But I wonder, wouldn't it be more appropriate to have the constellations from when the sparks flew in the zygoteâ€”when the two eggs connected?"
"Urgh," she said. "How would I know when that was?"
"You should know. I'm guessing you were there."
"You're just saying this for the 'wow' effect, aren't you?"
"No, sometimes I do, but this time I was serious."
