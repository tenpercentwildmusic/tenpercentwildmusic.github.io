# Relax, DAMMIT! album

The concept for "Relax, dammit" had been evolving for years, but the phrase itself was born during a COVID-era call with a friend who owns a yoga studio.
&nbsp;

When I asked how she was managing financially, she admitted, "Not very good, to be honest. But I have enough for food, at least."
&nbsp;

Shocked, I asked, "Is it that bad?"
&nbsp;

"Yes," she replied. "Usually, my sessions are full, but nowadays... no one wants to relax, dammit."
