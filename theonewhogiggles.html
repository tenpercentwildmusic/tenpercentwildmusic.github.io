The one who giggles


I know someone who responds to everything with a giggle. It's so cute and energizing that some days I wish I could record it and play it on a loop.

Other days, it makes me wonder.

Once, as an experiment, I greeted them with, "Hi, did you know there was a nuclear explosion five minutes ago?"

They giggled.

I'm all for a positive mindset, but that crosses a line.
