You wanna talk about it, huh

An old friend and I have a long-running bit that we've performed on several occasions.

Whenever we happen to pull into the same parking lot at the same time—on our way to get coffee, for instance—we turn it into a show. We park our cars, step out, and slam the doors. Then, with dramatic waves of our hands, we stride toward each other like two characters about to have a roadside fight. One or both of us will start yelling, "You wanna talk about it, huh?!" or "You want a piece of me?!"—whatever ridiculous taunt we can think of in the moment.

Passersby inevitably stop and stare, their faces filled with alarm. That's when we break character, bursting into laughter and giving each other a huge hug, which apparently makes people even more confused and scared.

Then, as if nothing happened, we casually start chatting about the most ordinary, funny things.
