#Do I need a shrink or a lover:

Sometimes the most serious challenge is simply being able to say "no."

I was once at a cafe with a friend who was working through some issuesâ€”mostly baggage from childhood. Nothing too severe, just a passive-aggressive mother, a deceased father, and all that.
We met so he could tell me about his current challenges, namely how his wife abuses him and regularly threatens divorce.
I listened patiently as he detailed the progress he was making in therapy. After two years of conversations, they had identified that his main issue was rooted in the fact that he couldn't say "no."

"Hmm," I said, quickly grabbing his hand before he could think. "Can I kiss you right now?"
"NOOOOOO!" he yelled.
"See? You are perfectly capable of saying no. And now you also know how it feels."

The rest of our coffee shop visit was quiet and uneventful.

The next day, he called me. "I just wanted to thank you," he said. "My shrink also thinks you're a genius. You solved in five minutes what he's been trying to solve for two years."
