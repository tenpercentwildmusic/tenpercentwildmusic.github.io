# The local drunkie

As a form of mindfulness, I sometimes sit on a bench outside the local store and just watch the passersby. All kinds of people with all kinds of stories, from suited-up professionals rushing by to the slow, eternal drunkies. It's a good way to fine-tune one's perspective on life.

Once, a local drunkie sat down next to me and asked to borrow ten bucks.
I said, "No, because if I give you ten bucks, I don't know what you'll do with them. But I can buy you something."
He asked for cigarettes and two beers. "Lunch," he said.
I can't judge what he does with money I've already decided to give. Who am I to judge (within reason, of course)?

He promised to pay me back on Friday. Of course, he didn't.
On Saturday, I saw him and asked, "Hey, where's my money?"
He launched into an elaborate story about how the bank had closed the account he'd had since he was a teenager, suspecting him of money laundering.
I giggled and asked, "The money you were going to give me—is it washed or not?"
He giggled. I giggled. We all giggled.

No judgement on my part—but I never offered ten bucks to the local drunkie again.
