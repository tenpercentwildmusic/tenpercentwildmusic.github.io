# About

As the home page mentioned, TenPercent is a creative collective of artists defying gravity and definition. Or they're trying to. It's a pursuit that needs no purpose.

The music relates to fiction, the fiction relates to characters, the characters relate to music. It is a whirlwind, a whirlpool, an abyss, a tumbleweed...

&nbsp;


The collective's first album "The Way I See You" ([Tidal](https://tidal.com/album/404888449), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7tbjDXyDb9xRLqWtjED6ae?si=AFJ4-jH6SEWEULfsOhJQKQ), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8uJ8n_Tm1koaYPvT5ARVA)) dropped on December 11th, 2024, and the world didn't exactly tremble. Its few monthly listeners were mostly the result of diligent campaigning among friends, neighbors, parents, and the obliging family pets.

Get ready for the collective's second album, "Relax, DAMMIT." The project questions the very notion of relaxation in a world of self-induced stress and constant information overloads.
