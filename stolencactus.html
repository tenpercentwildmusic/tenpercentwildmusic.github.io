The stolen cactus


There's a young girl in the neighborhood who suffers from a bringht and restless mindâ€”ever inquisitive and demanding clarity. I call her Miss Island Sunrise. She's about eleven or twelve.

One day, our paths crossed at the tram station as she was coming home from school. I asked her directly, "Hey, Little Miss Island Sunrise, how is it going with growing up?"
"It's tough," she said without a moment's pause.
"Okay, and what's the toughest part?" I asked, my curiosity vivid.
"People," she stated. "People are the toughest part of growing up."
"I don't see how that's tougher than stealing a cactus, or?" I buzzed her, trying to lighten the mood.
"Yeah, I think it is," she said, and continued walking up the stairs without a smile.

I really wonder sometimes what she has seen and what she will see. Her universe seems truly endless.
