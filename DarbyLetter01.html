<p> &nbsp; </p>



<p>Darby,
</p>
<p>I am the person who mentioned in a comment some days ago that “pigs and poets usually get the most respect after their death”. Then I asked you where and how I could send the pigeons with my letter, if I had questions and wanted to write to you. Hope the pigeons find you to deliver  this message.
</p>
<p>After reading parts of your book and the article about your mom on your site, I have a feeling that you are neither a pig nor a poet, so the statement does not apply to you. 
</p>
<p>I have the feeling that you are a genius and that you have already made quite some contributions to the well-being of the world. You are well-appreciated before your death, I gather.
</p>
<p>Most of your book kept hitting me like a ghost train - you know the feeling: after the third ghost train passes through you, you just enjoy the sense of ghost wind more and more, while your inner self smiles more and more to extremes. A contagious laughter which spreads around like a wildfire - first the inner child starts giggling, then the future pensioneer-child, then the ghosts and all their predecessors. It is a giggle-ghost-train-party, your book.
</p>
<p>However, for me, the most massive blow was your writing about “cynicism is easy, but warmth is harder to write”. Or something in this sense, as I hear it. (Here is the actual quote: “Writing optimism that’s more than “I like life” is hard. Cynicism is easy.”)
</p>
<p>After reading your article, I felt extreme joy. I have had this idea of my own for the past 10 years, to write a book called “My grandma says”, and I have collected quite a few stories through the years. It wasn't going so well, and at times I was wondering why. 
</p>
<p>I had tested some of the stories on some friends, acquaintances and even on some strangers, and they mostly giggled. Yet again, I was feeling like I was in the fog with the concept.
</p>
<p>My grandma (yes, the character was a mix between all my grandparents and parents, an amalgam of rural wisdom of sorts) was quite a quirky literary character, saying stuff like:
</p>
<p>“Darling, if I have learned one thing in this life it is not to work too much. Trust me, nothing good comes out of working too much. From too much work only your back will hurt and nothing else. It is not worth it. Just work normally, if you can help it."
</p>
<p>My grandma was also the character who would kneel every evening, with her elbows on her bed and pray (who knows to whom, really!): “Oh dear, please don't let me get bored. Boredom is a plague, keep me away from it.”

</p>
<p>Here is my joy and realization, Darby! I am glad I never finished my book, because it is full of bitter statements about life - bitter-sweet at best. The world simply does not need them, no matter how real or funny they may be. 

</p>
<p>The world needs a book like yours - full of dreams, cotton candy and love. 

</p>
<p>My grandma used to say: “Darling, if one day, by any chance, you feel as if everything is good, as if you have no problems at all, if you feel like absolutely nothing bothers you… just take a small stone, put it in your shoe and keep walking. It will help you with your perspectives.” 

</p>
<p>As funny as it is, it is also bitter. And as much as I  have collected all of this quirkiness, I doubt that in the big scheme of things it would have been as useful as your book, which is full of warmth.

</p>
<p>There was a time long back when I thought for a second that people can adjust their mindset for the better if they are exposed to the ugly devastating mindsets of others. But after reading your book, I think I was wrong.

<p> &nbsp; </p>
</p>
<p>So, Darby, here I am, standing on the ghost train tracks, tickled by the ghost wind of your book, while at the same time I have my own personal “cold water bucket challenge” going on, after the realization that the character of love in your book is million times more vivid that the whacky reality of my grandma, with all her zest.

</p>
<p>Thank you for this, it is a life-changing realization to some extent. It helps me move forward with my TenPercent collective, having the goal to lift up bright personalities. But this is a whole different story. 

</p>
<p>I still haven't got your book, all stores in my village claim it is unavailable. Maybe too few books were printed, maybe it is a PR trick… who knows. I will patiently wait to get it one day.

</p>

<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>P.S. I have another topic and a question for you, but will have to leave it for another letter: if no one ever found out about your success with “Darby, love”, would you still want it and work for it?
